I'm a person with a passion for technology. I can work hard to achieve my goals and everything I've got in my mind. Programming is for me, first of all, a hobby I love to do(_happens to be my job too_), a way to improve myself, and a tool to create and get the satisfaction from this. When you are programming, in any language, you can feel what it means to create something new, and believe me, it's so addictive.
